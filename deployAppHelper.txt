Deploy on serv :

Install node, mongodb, forever on your server.
Copy/Paste your repository in the folder you want.
Add the following line in your app.js :

app.listen(8080);  //you can use the port you want, but it have to be activated on your serv, in my case 3000 wasnt activated

Run mongo on your server.
Use npm start to launch your node app.

You should ne able to access your app, it's now running on your server.

Database security :

In mongo command line, process the following (replace user and password) :

use admin
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "myUserAdmin",
    pwd: "blablabla",
    roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
  }
)

Now stop mongodb, and start it with the following command :
mongo --port 27017 -u "myUserAdmin" -p "blablabla" --authenticationDatabase "admin"

Create a new User/Password for the amandine DB :
use amandine
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "amandineAdminUser",
    pwd: "blablabla",
    roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "amandine" } ]
  }
)

The last thing is to change the connectionstring in our app.js :
var options = {
  user: 'amandineAdminUser',
  pass: '8zt@A{t333c$DZ'
}

var MongoDB = mongoose.connect(mongoURI, options).connection;

Now restart mongodb with the command : mongod --auth
The database security is done.

If you want your app to run everytime/forever :
launch the db as deamon :
mongod --fork --auth --logpath /var/log/mongodb.log

launch node as daemon :
forever start -c "npm start" ./
